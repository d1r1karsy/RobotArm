Update 02/10/2020:
Things are all over the place at this point, just ask someone lol
But here is a summary:
- **Diagrams** has diagrams (what a surprise)
- **dynamixel** has dynamixel test code/python library
- **gpio** has the gpio test files
- **InverseKinematics** has the inverse kinematics python library library test code and URDF file
- **pidyna** has the PI python code for sending messages to motors along with Inverse Kinematics code and needed URDF files (duplicates from InverseKinematics)
- **ServoExamples** folder has the examples Brandon uploaded
- **StepperDriver** folder has the current stepper driver C++ class and Arduino code
- **STM32** and **STMLibrary** should have more goodness that deals with the STM32 microcontrollers




Update 01/22/2020:
- **gpio** folder has the test code for rpi4 blinking LED using the on board GPIOs
- **Diagrams** folder has the Draw.io drawings
- **ServoExamples** folder has the examples Brandon uploaded
- **StepperDriver** folder has the current stepper driver C++ class and Arduino code

Update 01/16/2020:
- **Diagrams** folder has the Draw.io drawings
